## Overview

Short Video Automation is a tool that simplifies the process of creating short videos. It combines various multimedia elements to produce engaging videos quickly. The key features of this tool include:

1. **AI-Generated Scripts**: Generate scripts with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). These scripts will form the basis of your short videos.

2. **Text-to-Speech**: Convert the generated scripts into audio using text-to-speech technology.

3. **Audio Merging**: Combine the generated audio with a sample video using FFmpeg to create the audio track for your short video.

4. **Image Overlay**: For specific keywords in the script, automatically download images and overlay them on the video.

5. **Background Audio**: Add a background audio track to enhance the video's appeal.
