## Overview

Short Video Automation is a tool that simplifies the process of creating short videos. It combines various multimedia elements to produce engaging videos quickly. The key features of this tool include:

2. **Text-to-Speech**: Convert the generated scripts into audio using text-to-speech technology.

3. **Audio Merging**: Combine the generated audio with a sample video using FFmpeg to create the audio track for your short video.
